                <h3>National Martyrs’ Memorial</h3>
                <p>National Martyrs’ Memorial situated at Savar, about 35 km north-west of Dhaka, symbolises the valour and sacrifice of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Bangladesh.A national competition was held for the design of the project in June 1978. Among the fifty-seven competitors Architect Syed Moinul Hossain's design proposal was selected. The main monument is composed of seven isosceles triangular planes each varying in size in its height and base. The highest one has the smallest base while the broadest base has the lowest height. The planes are folded at the middle and placed one after another. The highest point of the structure reaches 150 feet. This unique arrangement of the planes has created a structure that seems to change its configuration when viewed from different angles. The architect has used concrete for the monument while all the other structures and pavements of the complex are made of red bricks. Use of different materials has added to the gravity of the monument.  </p>

                <h3>Lalbagh Fort</h3>
                <p>Lalbagh fortress is one of the most popular recorded spots of Bangladesh. It is an inadequate Mughal Royal residence post at the Buriganga Stream in the Southwestern piece of Dhaka Bangladesh. D’Oily’s painting (1809-11) shows that more than half of this east-west oblong fortress touched the water of the river on its south and southwestern sides. It has three burials – Bibi Pari. Charles D’Oyly, Muhammad Habibur Rahman.</p>
                <p>Mughal prince Muhammad Azam, third son of Aurangzeb started the work of the fort in 1678 during his vice-royalty in Bengal. He stayed in Bengal for 15 months. The fort remained incomplete when he was called away by his father Aurangzeb.

                    Shaista Khan was the new subahdar of Dhaka in that time and he didn’t finish the fort. In 1684, the daughter of Shaista Khan named Iran Dukht Pari Bibi passed on there. After her passing, he began to think the fort as unlucky, and left the structure deficient. Among the three noteworthy pieces of Lalbagh Fort, one is the tomb of Pari Bibi.
                    
                    After Shaista Khan left Dhaka, it lost its popularity. The fundamental driver was that the capital was moved from Dhaka to Murshidabad. After the finish of the illustrious Mughal period, the fort became abandoned. In 1844, the zone gained its name as Lalbagh supplanting Aurangabad, and the post moved toward becoming Lalbagh Fort.</p>
